# Sharpen Up!

This plugin is tightly integrated with [OmniSharp-vim](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim) for C# development, providing default mappings and integrations that are better defined outside of OmniSharp-vim itself.

## Features

* ðŸ’¡ "Code actions available" flag in the sign column

#### Code actions available

A flag is displayed in the sign column to indicate that one or more code actions are available.
